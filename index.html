                        <p>ElaSQL is a distributed relational database system prototype that aims at offering high scalability, high availability, and elasticity to the on-line transaction processing (OLTP) applications.</p>
                        <p>To achieve high scalability, availability, and elasticity (SAE for short), many recent database systems (collectively, NoSQL) drop the support of relational data model and distributed transactions. The relational data model is
                            replaced by less expressive key-value pairs (<a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a>), documents (<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>), or entity-groups (<a href="http://research.google.com/archive/bigtable.html">bigtable</a>, <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">cassandra</a>). And the application developers are required to code around distributed transactions when necessary,
                            adding complexity to the applications. </p>
                        <p>ElaSQL does not trade the relational model and distributed transactions for SAE. Instead, it gives up ad-hoc transactions, i.e., transactions whose operations may be determined after start. Today, OLTP application developers (e.g.,
                            web application developers) usually design their transactions carefully and issue transactions via stored procedures. Therefore, it’s worthy to explore new system design that exchanges ad-hoc transactions for better SAE.</p>

                    <p>ElaSQL runs on multiple datacenters, each of which owns a full replica of data. Within each datacenter, the data are partitioned and placed on a cluster of machines/nodes. ElaSQL supports relational model and does not require data
                        to be perfectly partitionable. It handles distributed transactions across partitions in a replica. Therefore, it is suitable for complex, large-scale OLTP applications such as real-time data analysis, financial, and social networking
                        services.

                    <p>Without serving ad-hoc transactions, ElaSQL is able to pre-order the transaction requests totally (i.e., across all replicas/datacenters and partitions/machines). It then executes the transactions while making sure that the net effect
                        will be equivalent to that of serial execution of transactions following the total order. To do so, the Scheduler on each machine, once getting the total-ordered transaction requests, decides which transactions are “relevant” ones
                        that should be handled by the Transaction Manager residing on the same machine. Once the relevant transactions are determined, the Transaction Manager executes these transactions concurrently using multiple threads, and, in the
                        presence of distributed transactions, communicate with other machines (within the same datacenter) holding different data partitions.</p>

            </h3>
                    <p class=" ">ElaSQL assumes that datacenters are geographically separated across WAN to sustain the failure of an entire datacenter. Different from most traditional distributed relational database systems which adopt Lazy-replication techniques
                        giving only weak consistency between replicas, ElaSQL ensures that the replicas are always strongly consistent. It achieve so by making the results of transaction execution on each machine <strong>deterministic</strong> to the
                        total order; that is, regardless of transaction rollback, deadlock, machine failure, or any other events, the final results on each machine will be the same as those of serial transaction execution following the total order. ElaSQL
                        implements many techniques proposed by the <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2213838">Calvin</a> paper to achieve determinism, and with that ElaSQL can avoid any agreement protocol (e.g., two-phase commit (2PC)) running at the end of each transaction. </p>
                    <p class="">
                        Note that the total-ordering comes at the cost of delay (usually hundreds of milliseconds). So the transaction latency given by ElaSQL may be higher than that of lazy alternatives. However, as compared to traditional eager-replication techniques (e.g.,
                        those running 2PC), this delay does not count into the contention footprint in transaction execution, therefore has no impact on the system throughput.

            </h3>
                    <p class=" ">Inside each datacenter, ElaSQL can readily run on a cluster of hundreds of machines. It implements <a href="http://www.cs.nthu.edu.tw/~shwu/pubs/shwu-sigmod-16.pdf">T-Part</a> as the core scheduling and transaction processing algorithms and handles the distributed transactions in a super lightweight
                        manner. ElaSQL does not support ad-hoc transactions and assumes that each transaction request is issued as a call to a stored procedure. This make it easy to analysis the read set and write set of a transaction before the transaction
                        starts. Furthermore, with the read and write sets, the dependency between transactions can be known early. Based on this dependency, each transaction, when being executed by a Transaction Manager on some machine, knows exactly
                        which later transactions (which may not have started yet) will read its writes, and can <strong>push forward</strong> the writes to the corresponding machines immediately after commit. Then, upon execution, a later transaction
                        on another machine has no need to stop and fetch remote data because the data were pushed by previous transactions and may have arrived already. This (proactive) forward-pushing replaces the (reactive) data fetching mechanism adopted
                        by traditional distributed database systems (where there is usually a Transaction Coordinator that fetches data required by a transaction from other machines only after the transaction starts) causing transaction stalls due to
                        network latency and drop of system throughput.
